      "message": "I\u0027ve found myself mildly bothered by this mismatch as well recently, and would welcome the improved consistency -- however, the `start-ipkvm` name is unfortunately also hard-coded in various other OpenBMC repos, which will also need a corresponding update.  I see you\u0027ve also posted https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/openbmc/+/71773, but there are a number of other places that will also need a corresponding update: https://github.com/search?q\u003dorg%3Aopenbmc+start-ipkvm\u0026type\u003dcode\n\nAlso, for updating openbmc/openbmc it would be nice to do the name-change and SRCREV bump in a single commit so as to avoid the window of brokenness that will result if one part gets done before the other (ideally also in the same commit as a SRCREV bump updating the service-name strings in intel-ipmi-oem and service-config-manager...I *think* those are the only two others with an actual functional dependency involved, but it would be nice to do them all atomically).",
