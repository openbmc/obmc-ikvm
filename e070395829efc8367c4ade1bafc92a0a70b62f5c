      "message": "`shot` seems like a slightly cryptic name prefix to me; `screenshot` would be significantly clearer IMO.  Also, it would be nice if the name of the flag member reflected more about what its meaning is -- as it stands the only thing you can tell about it is that it has something to do with the screenshot mechanism, but that\u0027s it (from its usage it looks like it\u0027s a \"busy\" flag).  Continuing with the existing pattern of having a comment describing each member could also help with that.",
